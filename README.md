# ChANGE-HD
The first prospective, multi-site observational trial to systematically document brain structure and function during the premanifest phase of HD in children and young adults.  Participants aged 6-30 years who are at risk for HD. At each visit, cognitive, motor, behavioral, blood, and MRI data are collected.
